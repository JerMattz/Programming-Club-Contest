# Programming-Club-Contest
Design a simple mobile app interface for a to-do list. The app should allow users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. Focus on creating a clean and user-friendly interface using basic UI components like buttons, lists, and text inputs.

# App Interface
The app interface is straightforward and consists of the following components:

1. Task List

The task list is the central component of the app, displaying all your added tasks. Each task is listed with its name and a checkbox to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will be visually distinguished from the pending tasks.

2. Add Task

To add a new task, click on the "Add Task" button located at the bottom of the screen. This will open a text input field where you can type the name of your new task.

3. Mark as Completed

When you complete a task, simply tap on the checkbox next to the task's name. The task will be marked as completed and visually indicated accordingly.

4. Delete Task

If you want to remove a task from the list, swipe the task item to the left or right, and a "Delete" button will appear. Tap on the "Delete" button to remove the task permanently.

5. Task Count

At the top of the task list, you will find a summary of your tasks. It displays the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

6. Clear All Completed Tasks

For easy cleanup, the app provides an option to clear all completed tasks. To use this feature, tap on the "Clear Completed" button located at the bottom of the screen.

Tips for Use
Keep your task list focused and manageable. Add only essential tasks to avoid clutter.
Mark tasks as completed when you finish them to stay organized.
Regularly delete completed or unnecessary tasks to keep the list fresh and relevant.
